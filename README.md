## Amazon Echo Alexa Integration with IFTTT  for UK 

![alt tag](http://puu.sh/rUyPJ/7bccb76299.png)

Since the Amazon Echo is not working with the IFTTT in the UK I made a hack to get around it by creating my own Echo Skill and AWS Service to interface with the Maker Channel of IFTTT. 

Heres an example of it working, I said "Alexa, tell trigger test this is data" to trigger an email to me in IFTTT with the data values as the body.

### The UI 

```
Command >> Launch Maker 
  Response >> Welcome to if this then that, please tell me the trigger you would like to activate.

Command >> {trigger} {dataone} {datatwo} {datathree} using Maker
 Response >> I have triggered {trigger} or 
 or
 Response >> I'm not sure what you would like to do, please try again
 
  Reprompt >> Is that everything, say stop to end.
    Command >> {trigger} 
     Response >> I have triggered {trigger}
     or
     Response >> I'm not sure what you would like to do, please try again
       Reprompt >> Is that everything, say stop to end.
         Command >> Stop
          Response >> Thanks for trying IFTTT, have a nice day.
```
